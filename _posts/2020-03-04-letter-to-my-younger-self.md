Hi Madhu, <br/>
Whining over your handwriting and practicing cursive writing every single day? Set them aside for 5 minutes and listen to what I say.

<p>I am writing this letter to you as your 21 year old self. I am essentially still you, only that I am a little older and wiser. You would surely be having a lot of questions, especially regarding the questions that will come in tomorrow’s exam, right? (one typical Madhumitha Rajinikanthan, I have to say) But to be frank, I don’t remember any of those questions and even if I did, I wouldn’t have told you as that won’t foster learning. So before you drop this letter and begin to slowly walk away, have a seat and please hear me out.</p>

<p>I know we are quite stubborn and it’s possible you won’t listen to the advice below. Regardless, you will still live a fulfilling life (at least until you’re 21). I won’t ruin most of the surprises you have in future because knowing exactly what’s coming would take all the joy away. That said, please take what’s useful from this letter and leave behind what is not. And since we think in bullet points and absorb content best in that form, so here it goes…</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>First thing first, don’t ever be frightened of anything. The little school going girl that you are, you are a marvelous kid. All the tough subjects in school syllabus aren’t a big deal, you will still make it to the top. It’s okay if the other person is scoring 0.5 or 1 mark more than you, in the end, it does not even matter. Do not get upset over missing a rank, go out and play games, and make more friends.</li>

<li>
Be prepared- In eighth grade, your marks will suddenly come down and as a result our mother won’t allow you to go on that school trip to Wonder la. You will be pushed to believe that you’re not performing up to par with your classmates. Accept, listen and learn. We will apply these skills years down the road before our parents shed tears of joy on hearing our college teachers say “You are lucky to have such a daughter”. We must always appreciate the opportunity we are given to slow down, listen and learn. Time is everything. Trust the process.</li>

<li>
No one in this world is perfect and you don’t have to try so hard. It’s okay if you make mistakes or have flaws. Imperfections are meant to be unique. It’s what makes you, you. Learn to embrace yourself and love who you are as a person. Try not to worry so much about: your career, your weight, your acne, your future, etc. It all works out. We are warriors, not worriers. We have a tendency to make things happen (force it) at times. Ease up, sister. Be kind and smile. It’s good for the soul, it’s a mood-changer, it’s contagious and … it attracts. Kindness and a smile are the ultimate positive boomerangs.
</li>

<li>
Don’t let other people rent space in your head for free. That’s a valuable real estate. What other people think of you is none of your business. Be you and let go. Repeat. This is a tough one for us. It requires constant practice. We struggle and trip over this at times.
</li>

<li>
You’re creative and sometimes crazy, and that won’t change, so use it to your advantage. Creative people are the best kind. They have a rare insight into the workings of the world that the majority of people do not. Painting is incredible, and I’m beyond proud that you were able to recognize this early in life.
</li>

<li>
Our parents — our mom who makes sure we are dressed better than a high fashion model and our dad who lovingly calls us with cute nicknames — will give you advice that you will constantly want to block out, but just listen… or pretend to. All of their advice is worthwhile; we don’t know everything we think we do.
</li>

<li>
Our little brother, the one whom you shout on and wish the garbage man would collect, will (in a cliched way) be your partner in crime no matter how many times you both complain about each other’s existence. I know your personalities clash and that the differences in your characters outnumber the similarities, but don’t fight about trivial things simply because you want to prove the other person wrong.
</li>

<li>
To my younger self, after another dozen years, you will be more confident, smarter (I think), and generally better at life. But you’ll still be discovering yourself and the world. Let’s hope you’ll have many more years and decades looking forward. This is the most exciting time to be alive, so live like it.
</li>

<li>
What else is there? Your acne will eventually clear up, so don’t stress. Keep drawing and keep playing basketball. And please don’t forget that it’ll take a few bumps in the road to teach you that everything will work it’s way out eventually. Even if it doesn’t feel like it at that time, it always does.
</li>

<li>
All in all, just remember we are going to be an all rounder- good in academics, an artist, a basketball player, a blogger, and a little stranger and a little wiser, also a little taller, but still the same kid at heart.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Now owing to the fact that life is busy, I will have to end my letter here but with my best piece of advice to you, do yourself a favor and invest in bitcoin. Just kidding sis, get back to practicing cursive writing.
</p>

Love,<br/>
A Somewhat Wiser You
